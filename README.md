# scripts
Some scripts I use

upstream-tracker: A script to track how many patches from TI tree
		  made it into upstream.

find-duplicate-headline: takes a commit and finds another commit
			 (in a different tree) by the same headline.

rewrite-notes: takes a git notes file containing a set of commit ids
	       and replaces the commitids with ones having the same headline
	       from a new tree.
